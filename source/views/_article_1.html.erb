        <h1>Now What?</h1>
        <p class="description">For parents and children living with spina bifida, there's always a "now what?” that comes next. No matter if you just heard the words, or have known the diagnosis for years, every next step is a step into the unknown. But with the right community of people by your side, those steps don't have to be taken alone.</p>

            <h3>IEPs &amp; Special Education</h3>
            <p>Your child may be eligible for special education services in school. The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), entitles children with disabilities to "a free appropriate public education.” This is often called FAPE, or special education.</p>

            <p>Although each state and school is different, one of the most important parts of the special education process is creating a written plan for your child's education. This is called an <strong>Individualized Education Program, or the IEP</strong>.</p>

            <p>Developing the IEP consist of two important parts:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>IEP meetings, where you, your child and school staff members together decide on an education program for your child</li>
              <li>the IEP document, which lists annual goals and short-term objectives along with the services and support your child will receive</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>

            <h3>Special Needs Trust</h3>
            <p>If your child is receiving certain government benefits and receives an inheritance on the death of his or her parents, receipt of that inheritance may disqualify the child from receiving such benefits.</p>
            <p>A <strong>Special Needs Trust</strong> allows to you provide equally for all of your children, while preserving important government benefits for the child with special needs.</p>
            <p>Each trust must be specifically designed to suit the needs and situation of each family. A properly drafted trust:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>allows you to leave assets to your child with Spina Bifida</li>
              <li>provides for proper management of those assets during the child's lifetime</li>
              <li>prevents the child's inheritance from interfering with his or her government benefits</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
